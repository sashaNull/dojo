# Welcome to Pwnnsylvania!
Pwnnsylvania is an educational platform for students and other cybersecurity enthusiasts to delve into and practice fundamental cybersecurity concepts through hands-on experiences. This platform is crafted to guide participants from cybersecurity novices to adept individuals capable of engaging in (simple) cybersecurity competitions (CTFs) and wargames. 

Operated by a [dedicated team](https://splab.cis.upenn.edu/) of skilled security researchers from the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), Pwnnsylvania serves as a cornerstone for much of the university's cybersecurity curriculum. The platform is freely accessible to interested individuals worldwide.

If you have any comments or feedback, we welcome you to reach out to us via email at [sebastian.angel@cis.upenn.edu](mailto:sebastian.angel@cis.upenn.edu)!

# Great! How do I jump in?
Here are the current classes happening at Pwnnsylvania:

<ul class="card-list" style="display:flex; justify-content: center; list-style: none; padding: 0; text-align: center;">
  <li class="card card-small" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 10px; vertical-align: middle;">
    <a class="text-decoration-none" href="/cis5510~43a7c1be/" style="text-decoration: none;">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h4 class="card-title">CIS 4510/5510 - Spring 2024</h4>
        <div class="card-icon">üõ°Ô∏è</div>
      </div>
    </a>
  </li>
  
  <li class="card card-small" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 10px; vertical-align: middle;">
    <a class="text-decoration-none" href="/cis5560~75c6e09e/" style="text-decoration: none;">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h4 class="card-title">CIS 5560 - Spring 2024</h4>
        <div class="card-icon">üîë</div>
      </div>
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>

The exciting part of these classes? It's all about capturing flags ‚Äì those nifty data tokens you can trade for points. And how do you snag these flags? By taking on challenges!

So, each class has its own dojo, divided into modules, and each module throws various challenges your way. Solve a challenge, and you earn yourself a flag. Easy, right? Now, there are two cool ways to dive into these challenges:

- [VSCode Workspace](/workspace/vscode): Each student is provided with their own dedicated VSCode session for coding convenience.
- [Desktop GUI](/workspace/desktop):  For those who favor a GUI, there's also the option for a dedicated desktop GUI session, catering to different preferences and workflows.
- [SSH Public Key Support](/settings#ssh-key): Feeling a bit more hackerish? Set up your SSH client and connect like a pro. And for coding, embrace the raw power of Vim XD.

And because flags can be counted, there's a leaderboard for each dojo and module, showcasing the top hackers in action!

# Collaboration and Writeup Policy
The challenges created for Pwnnsylvania are educational material, and are used to grade students at UPenn.
Because of this, we would appreciate that writeups, walkthrough videos, and livestreams of challenge solutions are not posted to the internet.

<br><br>

# Further Practice
After you learn the basics of cybersecurity through our courses, you should move on to harder challenges.

Capture The Flags (CTFs) are a great way to practice your hacking skills in a fun and ethical way. The most popular way to find upcoming events is at [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org). There is also a list of introductory CTFs [here](https://zaratec.io/ctf-practice/).

Wargames are another great way to practice your hacking skills. Whereas CTFs are short (normally 48 hour) events, wargames are not time-based. You can find a list of wargames at [the Wargame Nexus](https://github.com/zardus/wargame-nexus).
